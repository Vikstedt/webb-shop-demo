# Webb-shop-demo 

This project was created to have an example of how an e-commerce is structured. 

And it is useful to be able to make it easier to develop future projects but also to learn. 

## How to get started

Follow the instructions at:
* `Backend`
* `Frontend`

## Bugs

Bugs that exist are mostly about design and how the website looks on different screen sizes.

## Future of the project

This project can be continued and developed even more, due to the fact that what exists right now is only the basics.

You can develop the payment functions, e-mail functions and better design for the exact reason for which the website is to be used.
