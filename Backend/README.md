* Business Logic: Implementing the business rules of the e-commerce platform, such as order processing and product availability.
* Integration with External Services: Connecting with payment gateways, shipping providers, and other third-party services.

## Technologies Used

* Node.js: Powerful JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
* Express: Fast, minimalist web framework for Node.js, providing robust routing and middleware.
* PostgreSQL: Robust, open-source relational database management system.
